    <h2> Favorite movie</h2>
    <p>One of my ultimate favorite movie of all times is <i><span id="favorite-movie-title">Hachi: A dogs
        tale.</span></i> This movie is about a loyal dog that would accompany its owner to work
    every day and would continue waiting outside (10 years) at the owners job waiting for him to get out
    not knowing the owner died. It was one of the movies that got me emotional and
    everytime I come across that type of breed in real life I get reminded of it.

    Here is the link see the <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/hachiko-dog"> movie plot.</a>

    <h2>Favorite Band/ Artist </h2>
        <p> My favorite artist is <span id="favorite-music-name"><b> Drake</b></span> simply because his music is more diverse than potatoes.
    He mainly focuses on Hip Hop/Rap but even when he tries to venture into a different sound such as
    Rnb, Trap and the type of music you'd listen to in Ibiza sipping on cocktails, Drake is the perfect person
    for that. His music is an experience and I hope to see him perform live one day.

    Here is a website about Drake biography. <a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/drake/"> Visit link</a>
